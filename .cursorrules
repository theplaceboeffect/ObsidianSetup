# When asked to `bake cake`

1. Review the tasks in `prompts/TASKS.md`
1. The different states are:
  - [ ] do not execute - this task is not ready to execute.
  - [R] ready to execute.
  - [I] used by AI to indicate the task is implemented. Mark the task with the completion timestamp: (`**COMPLETED**: YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`).
  - [X] task has been verified by human.
1. Identify all the tasks marked 'R' 
1. Determine how best to implement the tasks and report a set of actions to the user.
1. Request for permission to execute.
1. On affirmative, document the implementation plan in a `## implementation` section of the TASKS file. 
1. Execute the task and update the corresponding tasks in the task file.
1. Maintain the README.md to ensure it is always up to date.
1. Maintain a `prompts/complete-branch--<branchname>.ps1` file for each branch that will:
    - Import common functions from `prompts/complete-branch-common.ps1`
    - Define the branch-specific commit message
    - Call the shared `Complete-Branch` function with the correct branch name
    - Each branch maintains its own complete-branch script with only that branch's changes
1. Test the results in an isolated folder `tests/`
